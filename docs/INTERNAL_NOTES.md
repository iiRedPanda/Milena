# Milena Internal Documentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Memory Management
- Peak memory usage during game sessions
- Monitor memory usage with `process.memoryUsage()`
- Implement garbage collection when memory exceeds 75% of limit

### Performance Optimization
- Recommended to run on a dedicated VPS
- Use PM2 or similar process manager for production
- Implement database backups every 24 hours
- Monitor CPU usage and adjust thread pool size as needed

### Error Handling
- Monitor error logs in `data/logs/error/`
- Set up error reporting to Discord channel
- Implement automatic restart on critical errors
- Add rate limiting for API calls

### Development Guidelines
- Use ESLint for code quality
- Run tests before each commit
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Document all public APIs

## üìä Monitoring

### Resource Usage
- Track memory usage every 5 minutes
- Log CPU usage in 15-minute intervals
- Monitor database connection pool
- Track API response times

### Error Tracking
- Log all unhandled exceptions
- Track command execution failures
- Monitor game session timeouts
- Track database query performance

## üîÑ Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Tasks
- Clean up old log files weekly
- Backup database daily
- Update dependencies monthly
- Review error logs daily

### Security
- Rotate API keys every 90 days
- Update security dependencies
- Review access controls
- Test authentication mechanisms

## üìù Notes for Maintainers

### Performance Optimization
- Consider implementing Redis for caching
- Use connection pooling for database
- Implement request queuing for high-load scenarios
- Add rate limiting for public APIs

### Future Improvements
- Add more detailed analytics
- Implement better error recovery
- Add more automated tests
- Improve documentation coverage
