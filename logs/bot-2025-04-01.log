[2025-04-01 01:28:16] [INFO]: ‚úÖ Gemini Response: "As a large language model, I don't have "memory configuration settings" in the way a traditional computer program or operating system does (like setting RAM allocation or virtual memory).

My ability to "remember" things works differently:

1.  **Context Window:** My primary "memory" for our current conversation is the text we've exchanged so far within this session. This is often called the "context window." I process the recent messages to understand the flow of the conversation and generate relevant responses. The size of this window is predetermined and not something I can configure myself.
2.  **Training Data:** My vast knowledge base comes from the massive dataset I was trained on by Google. This acts like a form of long-term memory, containing information about the world up to my last training cut-off. This isn't configurable either; it's baked into my model.

So, I don't have settings you could tweak like "increase RAM" or "adjust cache size." My operational parameters are managed by the infrastructure I run on."
